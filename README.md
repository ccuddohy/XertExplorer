# XertExplorer
This is a UI application. The primary objective of the app is to make an improved tool to find appropriate Xert workouts. 

### Solution Details
This is a WPF application written using the MVVM design pattern. It uses a dll I wrote [XertClient](https://github.com/ccuddohy/XertClient) that wraps the public
Xert API. Both the app and the dll were written using .Net core 3.0. 

### About Xert
Xert is a tool for endurance athletes, cyclist and runners in particular, to analyze performance metrics. Among other things, Xert provides an Adaptive 
Training Advisor that attempts to recommend specific details about optimal training for the present time. The recommendation is based on data from previous
activities, the amount of time before the next competition and the current fatigue status.
