### About Xert
Xert is a tool for endurance athletes, cyclist and runners in particular, to analyze performance metrics. Amoung other things, Xert provides an Adapative Training Advisor that attempts to recommend specific details about optimal training for the present time. The recomendation is based on data from previous activities, the ammount of time before the next competition and the current fatigue status.
